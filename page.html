        <h3>6. What Personal Data do we share with third parties?</h3>
        <p>
            We may transfer your Personal Data abroad to third parties that may be located in any country in the world
            (in particular in other countries in Europe, Hong Kong, and the USA). These countries may have different
            laws about data processing and, as the case may be, data protection laws that have been deemed inadequate by
            competent authorities to protect your privacy rights.<br>

            The data recipients are obliged to protect your Personal Data in accordance with the agreed contractual
            obligations and the applicable data protection laws. If the level of data protection in a country does not
            correspond to the Swiss or European level, we will contractually ensure that the protection of your Personal
            Data always corresponds to the level in Switzerland or the EU. For this purpose, we agree with the third
            parties on the EU standard clauses and, if necessary, implement additional technical and organizational
            measures.<br>

            ​

            In particular, we may disclose your Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:<br>

                outsourcing, payment, user verification, advertising, marketing, analytics, anti-spam, anti-fraud
                services). These service providers may also use your Personal Data for their own purposes. Service
                providers provide information about their independent data processing in their own privacy statements.
            </li>

            <li> Buyers or merger partners: In connection with an actual or potential restructuring of part or all of
                our business or our assets or any rights or interests therein, we may disclose your Personal Data to
                potential buyers or merger partners or sellers and their advisors.</li>

            <li> Government agencies: We may disclose your Personal Data to governmental agencies, courts, and other
                authorities, both domestic and foreign, if we are legally obligated or entitled to do so or if we deem
                it necessary to do so in order to protect our interests.</li>
        </ul>
        ​

        </p>
        <h3>8. How long do we retain your Personal Data?</h3>
        <p>We only retain your Personal Data for as long as it is needed for the purpose for which it was originally
            collected or as we are required to retain it under applicable laws and regulations or contractual
            agreements.</p>
        <h3>9. How do we secure your Personal Data?</h3>
        <p>We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse,
            or alteration. Our employees and the service providers commissioned by us are contractually obliged to
            maintain confidentiality and to comply with the provisions of data protection law.<br>

            However, it is not possible for us to guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data. In this context,
            please note that data transmitted over an open network such as the Internet or an email service is openly
            accessible. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or content shared over these networks. Thus,
            Personal Data sent to us via open networks will not be subject to the same security measures as Personal
            Data contained within Boomboomtalk.</p>

            <li>Rectification: You have the right to have inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data rectified and to be
                informed of the rectification. In this case, we will inform the recipients of the data concerned of the
